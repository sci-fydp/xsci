What real-world problem does it address?
Since the emergence of the programmer profession, the developers have always interacted with the computer via a keyboard. Years of sitting in front of a computer can put a toll on the developers' bodies, increasing the risk of repetitive strain injuries (RSI).

How significant is the problem?
From a survey, 60% of computer users have wrist pain (http://consumer.healthday.com/encyclopedia/pain-management-30/pain-health-news-520/repetitive-stress-injury-rsi-646236.html). RSI causes all sorts of problems. Developers may reduce workload, reduce workdays, delay projects, lose jobs, and fail to perform daily functions.

How will the solution address the problem?
As an alternative or aid to programming, the solution will be an extension to the popular Eclipse IDE. It will feature spoken commands to file/code manipulation. These commands can generate template codes, help modify existing code, and manage the file systems. This will reduce the strains on the hands and help prevent RSI. The solution will address the problem by allowing users to code by talking to their machine.

What is the potential impact of the solution?
The solution provides an alternative set of tools to programming. At the very least, it adds flavour to a programmer's work. The best case, users will discover their own efficient tools that suit their style. Over time, the commands can be adjusted to generate other code templates and can speed up performance along with reducing the risk of RSIs.

What are the major competitors?
There are few competitors currently. Most of the competition comes from speech recognition software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking which can be used for basic coding. Furthermore, Tavis Rudd created a tool to code in python by voice two years ago. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI

What are their shortcomings?
Speech recognition software is usually aimed at general computer usage and typing and not geared towards programming.
The voice to code tool developed by Tavis Rudd is limited to python programming.
It is also limited to coding.

How does this idea address those shortcomings?
Supports C++, template code generation, file manipulation, useful shortcuts as well.
May support automatic code modularization and potentially auto generate code snippets.

Who is the customer and what are the expectations towards the customer and the group?
Our advisor: Chrysanne Dimarco, cdimarco@uwaterloo.ca

How engaged is the customer? What is the motivation of the customer to be very engaged? What are the customer's expectations towards the group? Does the customer expect the group to work on the project during coop terms? What are the expectations of the group towards the customer? How often is the customer expected to meet with the group? Will the customer answer questions from the group over e-mail or phone in a timely way?
Our product customers include:
Beginner programmers can use the code templates.
Developers who are suffering from and trying to heal RSI.
Developers looking to improve coding performance using an alternative method of programming.
What skills the group members should have to be effective in solving the problem?
Some familiarity with machine learning algorithms.
IDEs and familiarity with C++ and other programming languages (to work towards an extensible solution).

What would the students learn?
Natural Language Processing and deriving meaning from speech

What is the IP arrangement with the customer?
A discussion between the group and customer is necessary before answering this question. Currently, there is no IP agreement with the customer.
